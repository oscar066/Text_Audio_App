Revision Notes 
Ethernet Switching Basics - Data link layer protocols 
- Ethernet protocols deﬁne how data frames are transmitted over an Ethernet 
network

- It deﬁnes cable types & signal processing methods on a LAN

- Hub occurs at physical layer while switch occurs at data link layer-problem of 
collision and bandwidth sharing

- Star topology with switches separates collision domains, reducing chances of 
collision as the switch interfaces used to send and receive data are independent 
of each other

- Ethernet network- broadcast network based on CSMA/CD:-listen before 
sending, listen while sending, stop sending if you detect collision, resend after 
random delay

- Broadcast domain - all hosts in the same broadcast domain receive broadcast 
packets

- Nodes connected to all interfaces of the switch belong to the same broadcast 
domain

- IPv6 RIPng must be conﬁgured in the interface view

- RIPv2 multicast mode designated port does not receive broadcast packets

- Floating static route(preference value 60)

- Ip route-static 129.1.0.0 16 serial 0, 129.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2, 129.1.0.0 16 
10.0.0.2 - always start with the network address then next hop or interface 
keyword network address next hop 

- Telnet authentication methods: password authentication and AAA local 
certiﬁcation

- Fr inarp: command to enable dynamic address mapping protocol in the 
interface encapsulated with Frame Relay

- STP forwarding state can send and receive BPDUs,and forward frames

- DHCPv6 address auto conﬁguration (IPv6) Router Advertisements (RA) are sent 
by the DHCPv6  server, M and O ﬂags are 11- SLAAC and DAD

- IPv6 extension header Destination Option Header can occur twice

- DHCPv6 packet types: Solicit, Advertise, 

- IPv6 basic Header has a ﬁxed length

- Router g0/0/1 interface does not forward received FTP and SNMP packets

- RSTP(802.1w): Forwarding, Learning, Discarding, . Previous STP port states are 
combined- Forwarding, Learning, Listening, Blocking, Discarding

- In Ethernet_II Type/Length ﬁeld: 0x86dd - IPv6 (length 40bytes), 0x800-IPv4 
(length range 20b - 60bytes

- Vlan ID has 12 bits

- All ports on the root-bridge switch are designated ports.

- Maximum negotiation rate supported by IEE 802.11g standard is 54Kbps

- WLAN security policies that support the link authentication method of Open 
mode: WPA2-802.IX, WEP and WPA

- SNMP Response packets are sent to the NMS by the Agent on the managed 
device. SNMP client is conﬁgured on the agent while the SNMP server is 
conﬁgured on the NMS.eg Nagios NMS

- Flow label ﬁeld is added to IPv6


- RA (sent by the router to announce their presence I the network) in IPv6 is used 
to reply address preﬁx info while RS (sent by the host)is used to reply and 
request address preﬁx info

OSPF 

●

link-state routing protocol advertises link status information rather than routes in the 
routing table.

• SPF is a core algorithm of OSPF and used to select preferred routes on a complex 

network.

• The implementation of a link-state routing protocol is as follows:

▫ Step 1: Establishes a neighbor relationship between neighboring routers.
▫ Step 2: Exchanges link status information and synchronizes LSDB information 

between neighbors.

▫ Step 3: Calculates an optimal path.
▫ Step 4: Generates route entries based on the shortest path tree and loads the 

routing entries to the routing table.

▫ The network network-address wildcard-mask command specifies the interfaces on which 

OSPF is to be enabled. OSPF can run on an interface only when the following two 
conditions are met:

1. The mask length of the interface's IP address is not shorter than that speciﬁed in 

the network command. OSPF uses reverse mask. For example 0.0.0.255 
indicates that the mask length is 24 bits.

2. The address of the interface must be within the network range speciﬁed in the 

network command.

If priority = 0 DR and BDR will never be used

Establishing an OSPF Adjacency:
1.
Init - Hello packet sent from R1
2. 2-way - R2 replies to hello packet. R1 sets R2 status to 2-way then R2 sets R1 status to 2-way. Now 

3. Ex-start im the master and my router ID is_
4. Exchange - I’m the master and my router id is _. LSDB sharing complete
5. Loading - R1 sends LSR to request complete info. R2 responds with LSU. R1 sends LSAck then 

Neighbours

LSR

6. Full - LSDBs  of R1 and R2 are synchronised.

1,6,11 channels are used-done overlap
- If a link failure occurs on a network with IGP (OSPF for example), static, and blackhole routes, the 

static routes may be iterated to blackhole routes to remain active. The static routes will be 
preferentially selected over the OSPF routes because of a higher priority.

- Multicast address range: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
- VLANIF interfaces: have MAC addresses and need to learn them and must have different IP 
- Easy IP uses one public IP address while address pool uses many idle port numbers. NAPT 
- Authentication-mode none does NOT require a username and password
- IP address mask length 30 is recommended for device interconnection in campus network 
planning because it only has 2 usable addresses ie only 2 DEVICES are communicating with 
each other.

addresses

-
default-route-advertise: advertises the default route to a common OSPF area. If the always argument 
is not speciﬁed, the default route is advertised to other routers only when there are active non-OSPF 
default routes in the routing table of the local router.

Methods for interval routing - using a router, using layer 3 switches
Port 23 - telnet
STP port states - disabling, blocking, listening, learning, forwarding
RSTP port states - discarding, learning, forwarding

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) protects Layer 2 broadcast domains from 
broadcast storms by selectively setting links to standby mode to 
prevent loops. In standby mode, these links temporarily stop 
transferring user data. After the topology changes, so that the data 
transfer is made possible, the links are automatically re-activated.

- BPDUs: MAC address, priority, cost 
Network Loops occur when there are alternate routes between hosts. These 

loops cause Layer 2 switches to forward trafﬁc across the network 
inﬁnitely, reducing network efﬁciency. STP provides a unique path 
between endpoints on a network. These paths eliminate the possibility 

of network loops. STP is typically conﬁgured when there are redundant 
links to a host to prevent network loop.

The device supports the following Spanning Tree Protocol versions:
• Classic STP — Provides a single path between any two end stations, 

avoiding and eliminating loops.

• Rapid STP (RSTP) — Detects network topologies to provide faster 
convergence of the spanning tree. This is most effective when the 
network topology is naturally tree-structured, and therefore faster 
convergence might be possible. RSTP is enabled by default.

• Multiple STP (MSTP) — MSTP is based on RSTP. It detects Layer 2 
loops, and attempts to mitigate them by preventing the involved port 
from transmitting trafﬁc. Since loops exist on a per-Layer 2-domain 
basis, a situation can occur when a port is blocked to eliminate an STP 
loop. Trafﬁc will be forwarded to the port that is not blocked, and no 
trafﬁc will be forwarded to the port that is blocked. This is not an 
efﬁcient usage of bandwidth as the blocked port will always be unused.

MSTP solves this problem by enabling several STP instances, so that it is 

possible to detect and mitigate loops separately in each instance. This 
enables a port to be blocked for one or more STP instances but non-
blocked for other STP instances. If different VLANs are associated with 
different STP instances, then their trafﬁc will be relayed based on the 
STP port state of their associated MST instances. This results to better 
bandwidth utilization.

PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a link layer protocol that encapsulates PPP 
frames into Ethernet frames: 

-PPPoE is often used by home users and enterprise users to dial up for Internet 
access.
-PPPoE client can terminate a PPPoE session in unicast mode.
-PPPoE session establishment involves three stages: PPPoE discovery, session, and 
termination.
PPPoE client broadcasts a request for the required service information.

- UDP is the transport protocol for several well-known application-layer protocols, including Network 
File System (NFS), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Domain Name System (DNS), 
and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). 

Unlike the TCP, UDP adds no reliability, flow-control, or error-recovery functions to IP. Because of UDP's 
simplicity, UDP headers contain fewer bytes and consume less network overhead than TCP. 

UDP is useful in situations where the reliability mechanisms of TCP are not necessary, such as in cases 
where a higher-layer protocol might provide error and flow control. 

• ChatGPT
• Assigning an IP address, such as 10.10.10.1/24, to an interface serves the purpose of uniquely 

identifying the device on a network. The "24" in the subnet mask (or CIDR notation) indicates that the 
ﬁrst 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network, leaving the remaining 8 bits for host 
addresses. In this case, the network can have up to 256 hosts (2^8).

• Enabling DHCP (Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol) on the interface allows the device to 

automatically obtain its IP conﬁguration from a DHCP server on the network. By selecting "global" for 
DHCP, the device seeks an IP address from the entire network's available pool, which is managed by 
the DHCP server. This is an efﬁcient way to manage and assign IP addresses dynamically to multiple 
devices on the network, rather than manually conﬁguring each device's IP address.

• In DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol version 6), a DUID (DHCP Unique Identiﬁer) can 

be conﬁgured in VRP (Versatile Routing Platform) using two formats:

• DUID-LLT (Link-layer Address Plus Time): This format includes the link-layer address of the interface 

and a timestamp to create a unique identiﬁer. It is commonly used in Ethernet networks.

• DUID-EN (Enterprise Number): This format uses an enterprise number and a vendor-speciﬁc identiﬁer 

to create a unique identiﬁer. It allows organizations to assign their own unique DUIDs for their 
devices. Both formats serve the purpose of uniquely identifying DHCPv6 clients in the network, and 
the choice of format depends on the speciﬁc requirements and setup of the network environment.

2.- Transport mode: An AH or ESP header is added between the raw IP header and then 
encapsulated into a new IP packet with a new IP header to protect the IP header and payload.

- Tunnel mode applies to communication between to VPN gateways or between a host and a 
VPN gateway. More secure than transport mode because original IP packets can be 
authenticated and encrypted and internal IP address protocol type and ports can be hidden.

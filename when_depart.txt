"When I Depart"

When I depart from earthly ties,
And leave this realm of mortal guise,
Let not my absence bring despair,
For in the stars, I'll still declare.

I'll linger in the morning's gleam,
A whisper in the flowing stream,
In every breeze that softly sighs,
In each sunset that paints the skies.

Seek not my name upon the stone,
For I, as dust, will not bemoan,
The fleeting nature of this frame,
In cosmic dance, I find my claim.

For life and death, they intertwine,
A symphony, an endless line,
The essence woven through it all,
The call of Love, the cosmic thrall.

So grieve not when my soul takes flight,
Embrace the dark, the void, the light,
For in the essence, we unite,
Beyond the veil of day and night.

I'll meet you where the heavens meet,
Where souls find solace, love's retreat,
And there we'll dance with joy and grace,
Eternal union, time and space
